How to run the tests:

Use Thornlist to point to a thornlist in Cactus's directory of thornlists, e.g.

    export THORNLIST=$HOME/Cactus/thornlists/einsteintoolkit.th

Call the script, e.g.:

  bash ./recipes/ricci/build-and-run.sh 

The script will run the test interactively. This will not work on a machine
that requires you to use the queueing system.
